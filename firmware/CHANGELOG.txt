hedrot firmware, changelog:

Version 7 (24/10/16)
	. changed key strings from function TransmitInfo() according to the internal variable names (easier to handle on the receiver side)

Version 8 (04/08/17)
	. self test when the board is connected or reset:
		- if everything goes well, the onboard led should blink twice slowly (then itâ€™s ready for use)
		- if the teensy board can connect to the daughter sensor board but cannot read its data, the onboard led blinks fast endlessly	
		- if the teensy board cannot connect to the daughter board, nothing happens
		=> in both latter cases, there is probably a hardware problem: either the daugther board is damaged, or there is bad contact in the connections between both boards, or the main teensy board is damaged.
