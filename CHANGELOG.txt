hedrot distribution, changelog:

Version 1.2.2 (??/??/??)
	. bug solved: accelerometer hard offset could not be negative in the Max app

Version 1.2.1 (04/08/17)
	. version 8 of the firmware. Version 8 offers exactly the same functionalities as version 7, but adds a self test when the board is connected or reset:
		- if everything goes well, the onboard led should blink twice slowly (then it’s ready for use)
		- if the teensy board can connect to the daughter sensor board but cannot read its data, the onboard led blinks fast endlessly	
		- if the teensy board cannot connect to the daughter board, nothing happens
		=> in both latter cases, there is probably a hardware problem: either the daugther board is damaged, or there is bad contact in the connections between both boards, or the main teensy board is damaged.

Version 1.2.0 (02/08/17)
	. calibration routines ported in the library, completely rewritten and enhanced
	. experimental real-time magnetometer calibration routines
	. default headtracker parameters (MaxGain, acc LP filter, magnetometer rate) slightly modified for better results
	. added icon
	. added firmware for teensy LC

Version 1.1.1 (07/04/17)
	. minor doc update
	. better detection if magnetometer/accelerometer is calibrated or not
	. bug correction on 64 bits: invSqrt sometimes provided negative results (flips the sign of the quaternion but has no effect on the estimated angles

Version 1.1.0 (28/02/17)
	. GUI: window smaller
	. GUI: 3D visual display of the head tracker
	. ability to change the orientation of the X-Y-Z axes, the yaw-pitch-roll rotation order and to invert the rotation
	. doc update, examples with Reaper/Ambix, mybino and Max/Spat
	. OSC output: scaling options, for instance to control plugins in Reaper
	. the MaxBeta parameter can now be set to 0 in order to disconnect the magnetometer
	. Much smaller App « hedrotReceiver »

Version 1.0.3 (10/02/17)
	. Windows version
	. bug solved: hedrotReceiver: only yaw transmitted by default, although « yaw/pitch/roll » is selected on startup

Version 1.0.2 (20/11/16)
	. added sources of Max patch in the distribution
	. quaternion output (added an extra outlet in the Max patch)

Version 1.0.1 (15/11/16)
	. development bugfix: possible crash with max external when compiled in Development configuration
	. development bugfix: problem with search paths when including hedrotReceiver.maxpat in a bigger max standalone app
	. added version number to attributes of hedrotReceiver.app
	. hedrotReceiver.app: fixed problem with receiver attributes not being updated in the GUI
	. hedrotReceiver.app: various GUI optimizations

Version 1.0.0 (6/11/16) - initial release
